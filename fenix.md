# FENIX 4-8-37 Supply Logistics Flowchart to the Territorial Defense System

This diagram details the supply process of FENIX 4-8-37 rations, from raw material origin to delivery to the Territorial Defense System (SDT) and the feedback loop for continuous improvement.

The FENIX 4-8-37 ration is an integrated 24-hour, self-sufficient prototype, consisting of food packed in retortable and sterilized containers, formulated for immediate consumption or after heating. All components are contained within a high-resistance polypropylene master bag equipped with a ziplock seal for easy handling and protection. The FENIX 4-8-37 ration integrates the flameless tactical heater described earlier, consolidating it as a functional, compact, and self-sufficient combat feeding solution designed to meet operational demands.

It features three menus with deep Venezuelan inspiration, aiming to satisfy nutritional requirements and boost troop morale:
